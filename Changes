0.10  Sun Feb 08 2004
      - Stripped down test for IO objects, because it doesn't seem to be
      platform independent enough
      - ++'ing  version number to keep CPAN satisfied

0.9   Fri Dec 05 2003
      - Fixed magic() and default() to work on IO::something objects

      Fri Nov 28 2003
      - Added a "no warnings" in the default routine to suppress warnings when
      input is latin2 (thus neither ascii or utf8). Not sure whether this 
      really fixes the problem but it at least ignores it.
      The problem was reported by Daniel Raska.

0.8   Wed Oct 22 2003
      Seems that the new version of the mime-info spec takes longer then
      I expected, so I decided to release last weeks bug fixes.

      Sat Oct 18 2003
      - Fine tuned the method interface for describe()
      - Made mimetype -d -l .. default to english for missing translations
      - updated URL's for freedesktop

      Thu Oct 16 2003
      - Fixed small bug in Magic.pm causing a lot of warnings on 
      initialisation when using 'perl -w', reported by Steve Barton

0.7   Fri Oct 03 2003
      - Added File::MimeInfo::Rox
      - ++'ing  version number to keep CPAN satisfied

0.6   Thu Sep 04 2003
      - Emergency release because of a bug in the magic test file

0.5   Wed Sep 03 2003
      - added tests for magic typing
      - fixed design mistake in the basedir file search
      all xdg data dirs are now used, not only the first one found
      - put basedir code in a separate package called File::BaseDir

      Mon Sep 01 2003
      - disabled utf8 binmode layer for perl versions prior to 5.8.0

0.4   Wed Aug 27 2003
      - Added the --dir switch.

      Mon Aug 25 2003
      - Added File::MimeInfo::Magic that inherits from File::MimeInfo but
      also does use the freedesktop magic file
      - Shifted some code around in File::MimeInfo to make inheriting easier
      - Made the mimetype script work with Magic by default
      - Added the --debug switch to trace why a certain file is typed the
      way it is
      - Updated and reviewed the documentation

0.3   Sun Aug 24 2003
      - Moved file test operator stuff to a subroutine called inodetype()
      - Actually implemented the --file-compat switch
      - Added the -L and -i commandline switches for file(1) compatibility
      - Fixed a few bugs with relative file names

      Sat Aug 23 2003
      - Changed the script 'mimeinfo' back to 'mimetype' because
      rox has a '--mime-type' switch doing the same thing as this script.
      - Added the describe() method for getting human readable descriptions
      - Implemented the commandline switches --desc and --output-format

      Mon Aug 04 2003
      - Changed the script 'mimetype' to 'mimeinfo'
      - added some commandline options to make this script a little
      file(1) compat
      - added some file test operators for determining types from the
      inode/* class.

      Sun Jul 27 2003
      - use utf8 binmode for filehandles

0.2   Sat Jul 12 2003
      - bug fix for OO interface, forget to test the constructor :S
      - added specified default behaviour

0.1   Fri Jul 11 2003
      - original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
          -AX File::MMagic::Freedesktop
      - implemented finding file type by glob folowing the
      shared-mime-info-spec version 0.11
      - decided to rename it File::MimeInfo because it is less cryptic
