Revision history for Perl extension File::MimeInfo.

0.3   Sun Aug 24 2003
      - Moved file test operator stuff to a subroutine called inodetype()
      - Actually implemented the --file-compat switch
      - Added the -L and -i commandline switches for file(1) compatibility
      - Fixed a few bugs with relative file names

      Sat Aug 23 2003
      - Changed the script 'mimeinfo' back to 'mimetype' because
      rox has a '--mime-type' switch doing the same thing as this script.
      - Added the describe() method for getting human readable descriptions
      - Implemented the commandline switches --desc and --output-format

      Mon Aug 04 2003
      - Changed the script 'mimetype' to 'mimeinfo'
      - added some commandline options to make this script a little
      file(1) compat
      - added some file test operators for determining types from the
      inode/* class.

      Sun Jul 27 2003
      - use utf8 binmode for filehandles

0.1   Fri Jul 11 2003
      - original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
          -AX File::MMagic::Freedesktop
      - implemented finding file type by glob folowing the
      shared-mime-info-spec version 0.11
      - decided to rename it File::MimeInfo because it is less cryptic
